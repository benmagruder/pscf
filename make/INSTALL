 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007) David C. Morse

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents. 

 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation. A copy of this license is included in

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSCF can be compiled either using the unix make utility, using the
Makefile that is provided in this directory, or using cmake to build
a more complex makefile. 

See the file doc/user-man/compile-make.rst, or the corresponding page 
in the web user manual, for instructions for compiling using make, 
and doc/user-man/compile-cmake.rst for instructions to compile using 
cmake. 

For the impatient, brief instructions for compiling with make alone are:

1. Install the open source LAPACK linear algebra library and the 
FFTW fast fourier transform library. 

2. Change directory (cd) to the pscf/make directory (i.e., this 
directory) and copy the file config.mk_r to config.mk, by entering

>  cp config.mk_r config.mk

Explanation: The file config.mk_r is a default version of a 
configuration file that is stored in the git repository. Users can 
modify the operational configuration file, named config.mk, but should 
avoid modifying the repository version named config.mk_r.

3. Edit the file config.mk as needed, following instructions given in 
comments in that file and in the user manual.

4. To compile, issue the command:

   > make -j4 

from within the make/ directory.  This will fill the build directory 
with *.o and *.mod files and create an executable file name pscf in
the same directory.

5. To install executable files and python modules in subdirectories
of the base installation directory specified by the $(INSTALL) variable
defined in config.mk, enter:

   > make install
      
6. If desired, to remove all of the files generated by compilation from 
the make/ directory, enter:


   > make clean

To remove any files that were created by the "make install" command,
enter:

   > make uninstall

7. NOTE: Before modifying any of the source files, read the discussion 
at the end of the src/SRC_FILES file regarding the use of a python 
preprocessor script (FORPEDO) to automatically generate some fortran 
files from preprocessor input files.
