Add more consistency tests to basis_mod:

   - For closed stars:
       - Find partner of each wave, test complex conjugacy
       - If the wave is its own partner, coeff must be real

   - For open stars:
       - Find the partner of each wave in first, test complex conjugacy

   - Formulate clear conventions for coefficients in closed stars, based on 
     the coefficient of the first wave:

       A) If the real part is nonzero, it is positive
       B) If the coefficient is pure imaginary, the imaginary part is positive
