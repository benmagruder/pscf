File Name Conventions:

  Files named <base>_mod.f90  are Fortran 90 modules
  Files named <name>.fp.f90   are preprocessor input files. 

  The un-preprocessed version of the main program is src/pscf.fp.f90. 
  A corresponding compilable fortran program is generated by applying
  a preprocessor script, which installs the resulting program in the 
  build directory. See the end of this file for a discussion of the 
  use of a preprocessor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Several fortran files are generated by applying a python 
  preprocessor script named FORPEDO to corresponding preprocessor 
  input files.  This script is included as part of the pscf package 
  in a subdirectory of the tools/python directory. 
  
  The relevant preprocesor input files are:

     src/pscf.fp.f90 
     src/iterate/iterate_mod.fp.f90 
     src/scf/scf_mod.fp.f90 

  These are fortran files that contain preprocessor directives that
  control conditional compilation of some sections of code. The 
  FORPEDO preprocessor is used here in manner similar to the use 
  of the standard C preprocessor to control conditional compilation 
  in C and C++ programs. Preprocessing each of these files generates 
  a Fortran file with the same name as the preprocessor input file 
  without the .fp. string. The resulting fortran files are thus named:
     
     build/scf.f90 
     build/iterate_mod.f90 
     build/scf_mod.f90 
  
  These preprocessed fortran files installed in the build directory 
  from which make is invoked, rather than in the src/ directory. If 
  pscf is built using the simple makefile that is provided in the 
  pscf/make directory, then these files are installed in the 
  pscf/make directory. If pscf is built out-of-source using cmake,
  by invoking cmake and make from a build directory outside the 
  pscf/ directory tree, then these fortran files will be installed 
  in that build directory tree.

  An external script is used for preprocessing because Fortran 
  (unlike C) does not provide a standard preprocessor.  The use of 
  a preprocessor makes it easier for developers to maintain code 
  that contains experimental features that are not yet ready to be 
  released as part of a stable version, without maintaining separate 
  development and release version. Sections of code containing 
  features that are not ready for prime time are surrounded by 
  conditional compilation directives and are excluded from release
  versions of the corresponding fortran files. 

  If the *.fp.f90 preprocessor files are modified, and the program 
  is then recompiled using either cmake or the make file in the 
  pscf/make directory, then the *.f90 fortran files will be regenerated
  regenerated as part of the build process. When compiled with make
  in the src/make directory, the src/make/*.f90 fortran files are also
  removed by the 'make clean' command.
